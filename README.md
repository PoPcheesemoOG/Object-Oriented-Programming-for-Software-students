Name: **Paul Helske**

School: Southwest Tech

Course: Object Oriented Programming for Software Students

Description: This is to collect and show my work for the school. So far it just has the README file.

Bio: I am a 29M from Finland studying programming with the plan of becoming a video game developer. I love stories and I believe that videogames are the best medium for stories. I am taking this course because I wanted to learn object oriented programming and be able to work from home and create stories that others can experience.
